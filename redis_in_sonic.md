## Database names

SONiC maintains a schema for the databases in [schema.h](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-swss-common/blob/master/common/schema.h).

`0 - APPL_DB`: stores "key" operational state for entities configured in the system
`1 - ASIC_DB`: stores the necessary state to drive asic's configuration and operation 
`2 - COUNTERS_DB`: counters and stats for links etc.
`4 - CONFIG_DB`: stores the configuration of the system
`6 - STATE_DB`: stores the state generated by all application containers
